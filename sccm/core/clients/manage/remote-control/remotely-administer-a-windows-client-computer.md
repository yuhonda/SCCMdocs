# How to remotely administer a Windows client computer by using System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Before you begin to use remote control, ensure that you have reviewed the information in the following topics:  

-   [Prerequisites for remote control in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/remote-control/prerequisites-for-remote-control.md)  

-   [Configuring remote control in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/remote-control/configuring-remote-control.md)  

Here are three ways to start the remote control viewer:  

-   In the Configuration Manager console.  

-   In a Windows command prompt.  

-   On the Windows **Start** menu on a computer that runs the Configuration Manager console from the **Microsoft System Center** program group.  

### To remotely administer a client computer from the Configuration Manager console  

1.  In the Configuration Manager console, choose **Assets and Compliance** > **Devices** or **Device Collections**.  

3.  Select the computer that you want to remotely administer and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Device** group, choose **Start** > **Remote Control**.  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If the client setting **Prompt user for Remote Control** permission is set to **True**, the connection does not initiate until the user at the remote computer agrees to the remote control prompt. For more information, see [Configuring remote control in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../../core/clients/manage/remote-control/configuring-remote-control.md).  

4.  After the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window opens, you can remotely administer the client computer. Use the following options to configure the connection.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the computer that you connect to has multiple monitors, the display from all the monitors is shown in the remote control window.  

    -   **File - Connect** - Connect to another computer. This option is unavailable when a remote control session is active.  

    -   **File - Disconnect** - Disconnects the active remote control session but does not close the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window.  

    -   **File - Exit** - Disconnects the active remote control session and closes the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  When you disconnect a remote control session, the contents of the Windows Clipboard on the computer that you are viewing is deleted.  

    -   **View - Full Screen** - Maximizes the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  To exit full screen mode, press Ctrl+Alt+Break.  

    -   **View - Scale to Fit** - Scales the display of the remote computer to fit the size of the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window.  

    -   **View - Status Bar** - Toggles the display of the **Configuration Manager Remote Control** window status bar.  

    -   **Action - Send Ctrl+Alt+Del Key** - Sends a Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination to the remote computer.  

    -   **Action - Enable Clipboard Sharing** - Lets you copy and paste items to and from the remote computer. If you change this value, you must restart the remote control session for the change to take effect.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If you do not want clipboard sharing to be enabled in the Configuration Manager console, on the computer running the console, set the value of the registry key, **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ConfigMgr10\Remote Control\Clipboard Sharing** to **0**.  

    -   **Action - Lock Remote Keyboard and Mouse** - Locks the remote keyboard and mouse to prevent the user from operating the remote computer.  

    -   **Help - About Remote Control** - Displays ithe current version of the viewer.  

5.  Users at the remote computer can view more information about the remote control session when they click the Configuration Manager**Remote Control** icon in the Windows notification area or the icon on the remote control session bar.  

### To start the remote control viewer from the Windows command line  

-   At the Windows command prompt, type *<Configuration Manager Installation Folder\>***\AdminConsole\Bin\i386\CmRcViewer.exe**  

CmRcViewer.exe supports the following command-line options:  

- *Address* - Specifies the NetBIOS name, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or the IP address of the client computer that you want to connect to.
- *Site Server Name* - Specifies the name of the System Center Configuration Manager site server to which you want to send status messages that are related to the remote control session.
- **/?** - Displays the command-line options for the remote control viewer.
